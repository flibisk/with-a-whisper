WITH A WHISPER
Transforming brands into true luxury

Luxury doesn't shout — it whispers. The right people lean in.

I'm Pete, founder of With a Whisper. My work has always been about transformation through storytelling — taking something overlooked and revealing its true scale, emotion, and beauty.

MY PATH TO BRAND TRANSFORMATION

Diana Award (2009–2023)
Guided their brand from a micro charity into a nationally recognised organisation. Storytelling and film amplified young voices, winning visibility with government, schools, and global partners.

OffGrid Power (UK)
Founded a renewable energy company that built community-owned wind turbines and energy efficiency programmes. Storytelling was key to building trust with both government and local communities.

English National Ballet
Helped take an international ballet company beyond the stage by highlighting the impact of their engagement programmes. Produced a global documentary on dance and Alzheimer's, screened in cinemas worldwide — showing ENB as more than a dance company, but a force for social change.

Lowther Loudspeakers
Elevated Lowther from a small workshop repairing vintage hi-fi to the pinnacle of bespoke luxury audio — a heritage brand producing handmade speakers, amplifiers, and drive units for discerning collectors.

Luxury Hotels (e.g., The Arlington)
Creating cinematic films, immersive experiences, and high-end content to elevate hospitality into the realm of true luxury.
